- variables is a data container which holds some data in it.
- there are three types of variables which we can define in js.
  - let (let can be re-define but can't be re-declare)
  - var (can be re-define and also can re-declare)
  - const (neither can be re-decalre nor re-define)
  - use const (constant) as often as possible (i.e. whenever actually got the data that never changes) to be clear about your intentions (in your code).
