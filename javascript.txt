- javascript is a dynamic prgramming language.
- javascriptwasa created to make web pages more dynmaic,originally it was called livescript but due to the popularity of java, it was renamed to javascript.
- javascript is toatally independent from java and has nothing in common with java.

- javascript code execution runs on single thread on our operating system.
- chrome has V8 engine that parse, read, and executes our javascript code to our operating system.
  - like firefox has spidermonkey to parse, read and executes the code.


- variables is a data container which holds some data in it.
- there are three types of variables which we can define in js.
  - let (let can be re-define but can't be re-declare)
  - var (can be re-define and also can re-declare)
  - const (neither can be re-decalre nor re-define)
  - use const (constant) as often as possible (i.e. whenever actually got the data that never changes) to be clear about your intentions (in your code).

 - MORE ON STRINGS
 1. Tempalate literals - `${dynamic value}`
 2. let message = 'An error ' +
                  'occurred!'; // this is also a string without line break and without white spaces.
 3. let message = 'An error \n' +
                  'occurred!'; // from this \n we can have line break.


- FUNCTIONS                  
1. Define Function
        
function nameOfFunction(parameter){
  body of function;
}

2. Call Function
